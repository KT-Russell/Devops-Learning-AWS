# AWS Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **AWS Learning Repository**.  
This repo documents my hands-on projects and notes as I build and practice AWS skills for a career in Cloud & DevOps Engineering.  

The focus is not only on learning theory, but applying AWS concepts in **real projects** that mirror production-style environments.  

---

## Learning Goals

- Build a strong foundation in **AWS networking** (VPCs, subnets, IGWs, NAT, route tables, security groups).  
- Learn how to design for **security, scalability, and high availability**.  
- Gain practical experience with **Application Load Balancers (ALBs)**, **EC2**, and **CloudWatch monitoring**.  
- Document everything in GitHub as a portfolio of my progress.  

---

## Projects in this Repo

1. **[VPC Networking Project](./VPC-Project/README.md)**  
   Built a secure multi-AZ VPC from scratch with Bastion host, private instances, NAT Gateway, and CloudWatch monitoring.  

2. **[Application Load Balancer Project](./ALB-Project/README.md)** *(in progress)*  
   Deployed an ALB across subnets to securely balance traffic between EC2 instances in multiple availability zones.

## Learning Modules Completed  

- **IAM (Identity & Access Management):** Users, Groups, Roles, Policies, MFA, and least privilege.  
- **EC2 & Compute:** Launching instances, configuring AMIs, instance types, and monitoring performance.  
- **Security Groups & Networking:** Inbound/outbound rules, Bastion host patterns, and principles of least privilege.  
- **Storage (EBS Volumes):** Attaching, resizing, and managing persistent storage for EC2.  
- **Load Balancing & Scalability:** Using Elastic Load Balancers (ALBs), Auto Scaling Groups, and health checks.  
- **Containers:** Intro to ECS/EKS, containerised workloads, and Docker on AWS.  
- **Serverless:** Working with AWS Lambda, triggers, and serverless design patterns.  
- **AWS Networking:** VPCs, subnets, IGWs, NAT Gateways, route tables, and hybrid networking basics.  
- **DNS (Route 53):** Domain registration, hosted zones, A/AAAA/CNAME records, and routing policies.  
- **CDN (CloudFront):** Content delivery optimisation, caching strategies, and distribution setup.  
- **â€¦and more:** Continuing to expand into monitoring, automation, and cost optimisation.
